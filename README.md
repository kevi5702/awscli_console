PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
\n-The Goal of this project is to make launching fleets of servers a bit easier.
  -The project will start with a small feature set and move to a larger one as time goes on.
  -The first feature to get attention will be the EC2 infrastructure. Initially, this will just launch, describe, stop, start, and remove servers. This will initially start with hard coded VPC configurations (ie. use the default VPC) and will not allow use of the EC2 classic infrastructure launches as this is legacy infrastructure that likely will be replaced down the road.
  -For the moment, this describes instances and outputs it to the terminal. This will later be removed in favor of a more silent action.

  -For now, this project will remain fairly simplistic while I learn python.
  
  -To run the software, you are going to need version 2.7 of python as I am not currently going to program for version 3.x.
  -Also, you will use the following at the command line to execute the software:
    $ python lpython1.py

  - The naming schema here is learningpython1.py because I am currently learning python and this is the first program instantiation. This is going to be where I add new features and likely will be removed in future relases once my grasp of python is better.
